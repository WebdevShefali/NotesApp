// Next.js often runs in a development environment with hot-reloading. This means your app code can be reloaded multiple times during development, which can lead to the same model being defined multiple times, causing errors.
// Without this pattern, on every hot-reload, Mongoose might attempt to define the User model again, resulting in an error
// This ensures that if the model is already registered (i.e., it exists in models), it wonâ€™t try to define it again.
